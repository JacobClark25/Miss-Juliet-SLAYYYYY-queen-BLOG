I just met the love of my life! <3 But there is one small problem, he is a member of the Montague family. He has brown hair and brown eyes. He is REALLY tall. I talked about him with my girlfriends, and they swoon every time I describe him. He is by far the hottest man I have ever met. He is a great kisser. And get this, he climbed over my house's guard walls to meet me tonight! He has such a distinct voice, and it’s like music to my ears. He says he wants to get married tomorrow and will tell me where to go at 9 in the morning!";

I can not believe that I will be marrying the love of my life so soon! The nurse is very excited, and has told me to get ready. I hope that we can run away together and make a family! To think that in a few hours, we will be officially married, and there is nothing people can do to stop it <3  A day ago, I rejected Count Paris’ marriage proposal, but now it feels completely different. I got a new carrier pigeon as my last one broke its wing trying to deliver this to so many people. Even though it is only a few hours, it feels like an eternity waiting to get married to Romeo.";

I have told Friar Lawrence, and he made me a potion to drink to fake my death so that I don’t have to marry Paris, and run away with Romeo to Mantua. The friar will be delivering a message to Romeo in the morning to prepare for when I wake up, with the location of my tomb, and the time that I will wake up. Friar Lawrence says that it will be like awaking from a refreshing sleep. He says to drink it before I go to sleep.";
